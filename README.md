# Time Series Forecasting Project

## Overview

This project aims to apply advanced machine and deep learning models to time series forecasting. Various learning models including, **LSTM**, **BiLSTM**, **ConvLSTM**, **GRU**, **LightGBM**, **RandomForest**, **ResLSTM**, **RNN**, and **XGBoost** are developed. To have a fair and comprehensive analysis of performance, the models are tested on standard time series data including **Electricity Transformer Temperature (ETT)**, **Electricity load demand**, **Traffic**, **weather**, and **finance** datasets.
